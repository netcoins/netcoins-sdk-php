# Netcoins SDK (PHP)

This dev kit aims to offer easy to use, highly configurable access to the Netcoins Inc API.

## Installation

Use [composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/) to install the library.

```bash
composer require netcoins/netcoins-sdk-php
```

## Usage

**Netcoins SDK has a minimum requirement of PHP 7.3.**

Currently most endpoints require authentication. You can authenticate by configuring your Netcoins login credentials and passing them to the Netcoins Client.

Please [contact our developers](#) for full access to the Netcoins API. We will provide you with your auth `token`.

If you do not provide the environment configuration, the client will default to `sandbox` mode. When you are ready to switch to production, set the environment value to `production`.

```php
use Netcoins/Client as Netcoins;

$netcoins = new Netcoins([
    'token' => 'your_given_auth_token',
    'environment' => 'sandbox',
]);

...
```

**We currently support 14 tradeable pairs.**

To fetch a list of available trade pairs:

```php
...

$assets = $netcoins->assets();

print_r($assets);

// outputs:
/*
array(14) {
  ["BTC:CAD"] => string(26) "Bitcoin - Canadian Dollars"
  ["LTC:USD"] => string(27) "Litecoin - American Dollars"
  ...
}
*/
```

To fetch a list of ticker prices:

```php
...

$prices = $netcoins->prices();
//or
$prices = $netcoins->prices('btc', 'cad');

// outputs:
/*
array(14) {
  ["BTC:CAD"] => array(3) {
    ["buy"] => string(8) "13639.86"
    ["sell"] => string(8) "13474.29"
    ["date"] => string(19) "2020-09-11 07:27:03"
  },
  ...
}
*/
```
